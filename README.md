# Pizza Tower ONLINE
This is the source code of a very old mod for Pizza Tower's 2020 Western build, adding online and various other features.
We're remaking the mod in the form of [Pizza Tower: Cheesed Up!](https://discord.gg/thenoise)

It was left in a very unstable state between the April 2021 build and Eggplant (June 2022) build port process, because I gave up halfway through.
It's practically unplayable.

The online part of this game uses [GameMaker Server](https://gamemakerserver.com/).
This extension is at the end of its life (it will be shut down), and it was honestly horrible for making any actual gameplay.
